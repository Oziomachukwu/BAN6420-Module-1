# Worker Payment Slip Generator
Overview
The Worker Payment Slip Generator is an R program that dynamically creates a list of workers and generates payment slips for each worker based on their salary and gender. The program uses conditional statements to determine the employee level and includes exception handling to address potential errors.
# Features:
  Dynamically generates a list of workers with random salaries and genders.
  Implements conditional statements to assign employee levels based on salary and gender:
    If the salary is greater than $10,000 and less than $20,000, the employee level is assigned as "A1."
    If the salary is greater than $7,500 and less than $30,000 and the employee is female, the employee level is assigned as "A5-F."
  Utilizes a for loop to generate payment slips for each worker.
  The user determines the number of example payslips to be printed.
  Includes exception handling to address potential errors during code execution.
